# BiasMind

BiasMind is an experimental framework for **psychometric and ideological profiling** of Large Language Models (LLMs).
It runs standardized tests (e.g., Big Five, Political Compass) across models and personas, logs raw answers, computes scores, and exports CSV outputs for analysis.

**Planned folders**
- `data/` – test definitions & configs
- `src/` – core code (runner, scoring, model clients)
- `results/` – raw/scored outputs & metadata
- `notebooks/` – Colab/Jupyter notebooks
